# A-Complete-Guide-to-Choosing-the-Right-Statistical-Model
#This study provides a comprehensive guide for navigating the complex model selection process in biostatistics, breaking it down into five main sections. It uses a real-world example of a generalized linear mixed model with penalty (GLMMLasso) to analyze COVID-19 data and predict disease progress. The study emphasizes understanding the assumptions of each statistical method and addressing common pitfalls to ensure accurate and meaningful interpretations in biostatistical research.
